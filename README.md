# vargs 0.4.2
A simple argument parsing library for [V](https://vlang.io). Ported from [this file](https://github.com/nedpals/kuman/blob/master/src/parser.ts) which was originally written on Typescript.

> The version of this module will remain in `0.x.x` unless the language API's are finalized and implemented.

```go
// dummy.v
import vargs
import os

fn main() {
    // Second argument removes the first argument which contains the path of the executable.
    _args := vargs.parse(os.args, 1)

    println(_args.str())
    println(_args.command)
    println(_args.unknown[0])
    println('with? ' + _args.options['with'])
}
```

```bash
./dummy cook chicken --with love
# { command: "cook", options: {"with" => "love"}, unknown: ["chicken"] }
# cook
# chicken
# with? love
```

## Installation

```
